# Current State — 2026-06-03

## Build
- **Production Debug:** ✅ Passing via `./gradlew assembleProductionDebug`
- **DB:** v14 · **Branch:** `ios-parity-transport-build`
- CI build fix: Gradle now includes only `app/libs/libbox.aar`; stale `app.rcq.android` code and `rcqbox.aar` are moved to `reference/android-legacy` instead of being hidden by a custom source-set.

## Working ✅
- Registration + JWT auth + ECIES key generation (iOS-compat)
- Outgoing messages (Android → iPad confirmed working)
- Incoming messages (with 🔒 placeholder if decrypt fails)
- Contact sync, group sync (all user groups shown correctly)
- Chat list sync: client-only `/chats` is not called; chat rows are derived from Room rows and `/messages/queue`
- Main chats screen now uses an `InboxUiState`/`InboxMapper` hub model that combines chats, contacts, and groups. Groups such as `RCQ Beta` and default contacts such as `.Dev` can appear even before they have messages.
- Add Contact request parity: Android sends `POST /contacts/request` with iOS-compatible `{ "to_uin": ... }`, refreshes contacts after success/duplicate, and maps HTTP 409 to a duplicate-contact error.
- WebSocket: connect, send, receive, reconnect with backoff; Android WS URL builds `wss://` safely after OkHttp `HttpUrl` construction
- WebSocket backend parity pass: call events now use server fields (`media`, `sdp`, `candidate`, `reason`), `call_ice` parsing, renegotiate events, account burn, audio-room roster/member/speaking/mesh events, typed outgoing call/room payloads, and `GroupUpdated` sync/delete handling.
- Connection diagnostics: client-only screens are reported locally, relay probes are capped, and OkHttp debug logging is BASIC to avoid large-body stalls
- WebSocket envelope parity: `system`, `visit`, and control envelope kinds (`read`, `reaction`, `edit`, `delete`, `bounce`) coming in `MessageNew` are now parsed from decrypted payload and applied (message state updates, delete/bounce, reactions, edits, system notices) instead of being treated as generic messages.
- Dark mode (persisted DataStore, applied at launch)
- JIMM retro mode toggle (status-grouped contacts when ON)
- JIMM/QIP flat UI: compact 50dp NavBar, compact typography, status-dot rows
- Startup connection probe mirrors iOS: direct `GET /health` before auto-bypass, clears stale auto sing-box when direct works
- Stealth: ProxyManager AUTO/MANUAL/OFF, sing-box persistence across restarts
- Message send parity: `/messages/sealed` and `/messages/group-sealed` responses now mirror iOS (`delivered/queued`) status semantics in local message state, with safe handling of empty response bodies
- Embedded bypass is dual-engine on Android: sing-box remains for compatible relays; Xray-core executable handles VLESS Reality xHTTP. Local priority relays now prefer `relay-uk-google-vision` (VLESS Reality TCP Vision via sing-box) before the xHTTP USA relay. Users can explicitly select a built-in relay or add/select a custom `vless://` Reality URL before or after login. Device validation still needed for the UK/custom relay path.
- PanicPIN / Biometric unlock
- Delivery states SENT/DELIVERED/READ, typing indicators, presence
- Edit/delete/reactions, pin/mute/archive, message search

## Broken / Partial 🔴
| Issue | Root Cause |
|-------|-----------|
| Call UI needs WebRTC SDP flow validation | WS event/payload contract is aligned, but `CallManager` still needs real SDP offer/answer creation from `CallService` before live calls can be considered functional |
| UI still needs visual device validation | Inbox model and Compose screen now expose chats/contacts/groups together; verify `RCQ Beta`, `.Dev`, search, emoji picker, attachment sheet, relay picker, and custom VLESS entry on device |
| Add Contact flow blocked in live device validation | Backend request parity is fixed in code, but 2026-06-03 ADB run showed active sing-box relay `relay-do-fra-yandex-hy2` causing `SOCKS server general failure` / `connection closed` before Add request can reach `POST /contacts/request` |
| Входящие DM иногда показывают 🔒 | Signal-сессия не установлена для нового собеседника |
| JIMM mode влияет только на контакты | Другие экраны не читают LocalRetroMode |
| P5 Звуки / P7 Смайлы JIMM | Не реализованы (0%) |

## Removed 🗑️
- `WebSocketManager.kt` — дублирующий WS движок
- `GameRepository`, `GamesScreen`, `MarketplaceScreen` — удалены по scope
- `PetEntity`, `PetDao` — pets table (DB migration 11→12)
